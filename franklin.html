        <p>Boston, Massachusetts is home to the 72 acres (290,000 m2) Franklin Park Zoo. The zoo is situated in the northeastern corner of Franklin Park, which is the largest park in Boston and the final link in the fabled Emerald Necklace of the city. It is currently run by Zoo New England, which also manages the Stone Zoo in Stoneham, Massachusetts.</p>

The renowned Tropical Forest at the Zoo has five glass viewing stations where guests may get up close and personal with the western lowland gorillas. Visit the lions, tiger, zebras, giraffe, and many other extraordinary creatures that call the Zoo home as well.</P>
