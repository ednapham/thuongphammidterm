        <p>North of Columbus, in Liberty Township, Delaware County, Ohio, the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium is a nonprofit zoo. It is close to Powell. The property is located at the junction of Riverside Drive and Powell Road, on the Scioto River's eastern bank of the O'Shaughnessy Reservoir. Its international prominence is largely due to the promotion and work of director emeritus Jack Hanna. It was ranked as the best zoo in the country in 2009 by the USA Travel Guide. In addition, Besties Readers Choice recognized it as the best zoo in 2012, placing it first.</p>
        <p>The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, which is home to more than 11,000 animals representing almost 600 species from around the world, inspires and leads by bringing people and wildlife together.</p>
