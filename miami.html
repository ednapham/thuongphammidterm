        <p>The Miami-Dade Zoological Park and Gardens, usually referred to as Zoo Miami, is Florida's biggest zoo and is located close to Miami. Zoo Miami, which had been founded in 1948 at Crandon Park in Key Biscayne, moved as Miami MetroZoo in 1980 to the former site of the Naval Air Station Richmond, southwest of Miami, in southern unincorporated Miami-Dade County, bordered by the census-designated places of Three Lakes (north), South Miami Heights (south), Palmetto Estates (east), and Richmond West (west).</p>
        <p>Nearly 750 acres are now occupied by Zoo Miami, which is home to over 3,000 animals from over 500 different species. More than 40 species within this population are considered endangered. Additionally, the zoo is home to over 1,000 different varieties of trees, palms, and other plants, as well as over 100 special exhibits that cover a variety of scientific subjects and animals. It maybe met or exceeded the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' (AZA) requirements for animal health and care, fundraising, zoo staffing, and participation in international conservation activities in order to receive accreditation from the AZA.</p>
